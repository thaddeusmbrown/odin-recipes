This is my first attempt at the first project on The Odin Project for web development learning.

The aim of this project is to create a simple recipe website that has a main index page with a few links to recipes.

The project will demonstrate skills in basic HTML and Git, namely setting up a proper HTML boilerplate, creating links, lists, and image elements, and using version control throughout the process.
